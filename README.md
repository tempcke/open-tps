This project exists only as a way to run [OpenTPS](https://www.opentps.org/) inside a docker image.

This way you do not need to figure out any of the dependencies etc.

Be advised that I am not maintaining this for any purpose other than so my wife can run this on her local computer.  Her local computer is running linux mint.  So this works when run from linux mint

To run, assuming you have `docker` and `make` installed just run `make run`

My hope is that the authors and maintainers of OpenTPS will add something to their repo and docs for this purpose.
